In software engineering, *SOLID* is a mnemonic acronym for five design
principles intended to make object-oriented designs more **understandable**,
**flexible**, and **maintainable**.

## *S*ingle responsibility

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

## *O*penâ€“closed

> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## *L*iskov substitution

> Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

## *I*nterface segregation

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## *D*ependency inversion

> Depend upon abstractions, \[not\] concretions.

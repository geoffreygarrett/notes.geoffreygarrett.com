Density-based spacial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a
[clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) proposed
by Ester et al. in 1996. DBSCAN is one of the [most cited clustering
algorithms](https://web.archive.org/web/20100421170848/http://academic.research.microsoft.com/CSDirectory/paper_category_7.htm)
in scientific literature.

**Estimation theory** is a branch of statistics that addresses the estimation of
unknown parameters based on empirical measurements, which contain a random
component.

- An **estimator** is an algorithm that attempts to approximate the unknown
  parameters using measurements.

## Estimators 

- [Least squares](notes/least-squares.md)
- [Kalman filter](notes/kalman-filter.md)

## Applications

- [Orbit determination](notes/orbit-determination.md)

## Maps of Content üó∫Ô∏è

Here are the current maps to my notes. What you see here will change overtime.
They won't disappear, they might just be reshuffled and organised under new maps
that I deem necessary to add at a later time. For example, I currently have the
maps of [software engineering](notes/software-engineering.md) and [machine
learning](notes/machine-learning.md) present, with some [machine learning
algorithms](notes/dbscan.md) in [software
engineering](notes/software-engineering.md), both of which _might_ later be
found under **computer science**. Feel free to peruse, some notes may have
comments enabled if I feel that a note is well-developed enough.

- [Linear Algebra MOC](notes/linear-algebra.md)
- [Estimation Theory MOC](notes/estimation-theory.md)
- [Information Theory MOC](notes/information-theory.md)
- [Software Engineering MOC](notes/software-engineering.md)
- [Machine Learning MOC](notes/machine-learning.md)

## Useful üõ†Ô∏è

This section is a general catch-all for anything I feel I want to keep visible
on the surface. They might help me organise my thoughts in the long-term, or
lookup information and resources that I desire at my fingertips.

- [All Notes](/notes)

## Types of Notes ‚ÑπÔ∏è

As I pursue tending to my digital garden, with new additions, or modifications
to existing parts, you can expect me to (loosely) follow a (hopefully)
consistent categorisation described by the following:

- üå∞ A **Seed** might just be a note, link or some thought. Perhaps a
  placeholder for something I'd like to pursue later. These may be linked or
  unlinked, perhaps hidden away where no one sees them.
- üå± A **Seedling** is more established and ready to continue growing. It has 
  some weak parts, but it's getting there with time. Ideally it won't stay 
  a seedling for much longer, it just needs a bit of tending, water and sunshine.
- üå≤ An **Evergreen** has finished growing. It could do with some pruning once
  in a while throughout the seasons, but it's mature and isn't expected to
  disappear in our lifetime.

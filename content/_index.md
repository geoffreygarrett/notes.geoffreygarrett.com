## Maps of Content üó∫Ô∏è

Here are the current maps to my notes. What you see here will change overtime.
They won't disappear, they might just be reshuffled and organised under new
maps that I deem necessary to add at a later time. For example, currently I 
have `software engineering` and `machine learning`, with some `machine learning`
algorithms in `software engineering`, both of might later be found under
`computer science`. Feel free to peruse, some notes may have comments enabled
if I feel that a note is well-developed enough.

- [Estimation Theory MOC](notes/estimation-theory.md)
- [Information Theory MOC](notes/information-theory.md)
- [Software Engineering MOC](notes/software-engineering.md)
- [Machine Learning MOC](notes/machine-learning.md)

## Useful üõ†Ô∏è

This is a general catch-all for anything I feel I want to keep visible on the
surface. They might help me organise my thoughts in the long-term, or lookup
information and resources that I need I want at my fingertips.

## Types of Notes ‚ÑπÔ∏è

As I pursue tending to my digital garden, with new additions, or modifications
to existing parts, you can expect me to (loosely) follow a (hopefully)
consistent categorisation described by the following:

- üå∞ A **Seed** might just be a note, link or some thought. Perhaps a
  placeholder for something I'd like to pursue later. These may be linked or
  unlinked, perhaps hidden away where no one sees them.
- üå± A **Seedling** is more established and ready to continue growing. It has 
  some weak parts, but it's getting there with time. Ideally it won't stay 
  a seedling for much longer, it just needs a bit of tending, water and sunshine.
- üå≤ **Evergreen** has finished growing. It could do with some pruning once in a 
  while throughout seasons, but it's mature and isn't expected to disappear 
  in our lifetime.

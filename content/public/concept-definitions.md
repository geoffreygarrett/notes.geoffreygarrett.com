A dynamic collection of concept definitions which are either relevant to my work
or are of interest to me. These definitions may be referred to from other
parts of my notes. 

## _"A priori"_ and _"a posteriori"_

> _“A priori” and “a posteriori” refer primarily to how, or on what basis, a
proposition might be known. In general terms, a proposition is knowable a priori
if it is knowable independently of experience, while a proposition knowable a
posteriori is knowable on the basis of experience. The distinction between a
priori and a posteriori knowledge thus broadly corresponds to the distinction
between empirical and nonempirical knowledge._ - [Internet Encyclopedia of

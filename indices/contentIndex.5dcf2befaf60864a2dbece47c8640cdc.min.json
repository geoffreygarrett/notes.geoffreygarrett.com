{"/":{"title":"Geoffrey's Notes","content":"\n## Maps of Content 🗺️\n\nHere are the current maps to my notes. What you see here will change overtime.\nThey won't disappear, they might just be reshuffled and organised under new maps\nthat I deem necessary to add at a later time. For example, I currently have the\nmaps of [software engineering](public/software-engineering.md) and [machine\nlearning](public/machine-learning.md) present, with some [machine learning\nalgorithms](public/dbscan.md) in [software\nengineering](public/software-engineering.md), both of which _may_ later be\nfound under **computer science**.

Perhaps a\n  placeholder for something I'd like to pursue later. These may be linked or\n  unlinked, perhaps hidden away where no one sees them.\n- 🌱 A **Seedling** is more established and ready to continue growing. It has \n  some weak parts, but it's getting there with time. Ideally it won't stay \n  a seedling for much longer, it just needs a bit of tending, water and sunshine.\n- 🌲 An **Evergreen** has finished growing. It could do with some pruning once\n  in a while throughout the seasons, but it's mature and isn't expected to\n  disappear in our lifetime.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T09:30:38.948112687Z","tags":null},"/public/cholesky-decomposition":{"title":"Cholesky Decomposition","content":"\nCholesky Decomposition (_a.k.a.

The self-information was defined by Claude Shannon such that\nthe following axioms were met:\n\n- An event that is 100% probable is perfectly unsurprising and\n  therefore yields no information content.\n- The less probable an event is, the more surprising, and therefore the\n  more information it yields.\n- The total information of independently measured events, is the\n  sum of their respective self-information.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    I(x):=-\\log_b(p(x))\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n## Entropy\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    H(x)=\\mathbb{E}[I(x)]\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n## Kullback-Leibler divergence\nThe Kullback-Leibler divergence (a.k.a. _information gain_, _relative entropy_\nand _I-divergence_) is a measure of how one probability distribution $P$ differs\nfrom another, $Q$. For the distributions $P$ and $Q$ for a continuous random\nvariable, the relative entropy integral is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    D_{KL}(P||Q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p(x)\\log\\bigg(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\bigg)dx.\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nNote that $D_{KL}(P||Q)$ is only finite if the support set of $P$ is\ncontained in the support set of $Q$. In the context of Bayesian inference\n$D_{KL}(P||Q)$, read as _the KL-divergence of P given Q_, is a\nmeasure of the information gained by revisiting one's beliefs from a prior\nprobability distribution $Q$ to a posterior probability distribution $P$. For\nexample the $D_{KL}(P||Q)$ for $P\\sim{}\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1,\\sigma_1)$ and\n$Q\\sim{}\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2,\\sigma_2)$ can be derived analytically to be:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    D_{KL}(P||Q) = \\log\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2 + (\\mu_1-\\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2^2} - \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nOne noteworthy characteristic of the KL-divergence is its asymmetry, that is\n$D_{KL}(P||Q)\\neq{}D_{KL}(Q||P)$. This means that KL-divergence makes\nfor a poor _distance_ metric as is commonly done with, for example,\nsquared-errors. This may at first present KL-divergence as a suboptimal choice\nas a general metric, however when considering the relation between the posterior\nand the priori, the relative information gain when travelling from one to the\nother **is** inherently asymmetric by their very nature. \n\n## Jensen-Shannon divergence\n\nThe Jensen-Shannon divergence (a.k.a. _information radius_ and _total divergence\nto the average_) is based on the KL-divergence, however it has been extended\nwith the differences that it is symmetric, and always has a finite value.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    D_{JS}(P||Q) = \\frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(P||M) + \\frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(Q||M)\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{where  }\nM = \\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)\n$$","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T09:30:38.980113444Z","tags":null},"/public/javascript-dependencies":{"title":"Satisfying JavaScript Dependencies","content":"\n## [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](public/cdn.md)\n\n\n\n## Import Map\n\n## Node Package Manager (NPM)","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T09:30:38.980113444Z","tags":null},"/public/jetbrains-environment":{"title":"JetBrains Environment","content":"\nThis note is a general collection of plugins for JetBrain's products which I use\non a daily basis.

These are setup as demonstrated in the following code:\n\n````javascript {linenos=true, linenostart=5, title=\"/first-cube.js\"}\n// 0. Get your desired element to render on\nlet element = document.getElementById('threejs');\nlet w = window.innerWidth;\nlet h = window.innerHeight;\n\n// 1. Create a scene\nvar scene = new THREE.Scene();\n\n// 2. Create a camera\nlet camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(\n    75, w / h, 0.1, 1000);\n\n// 3. Create a render\nvar renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n\n// 4. Set the size of the render\nrenderer.setSize(w, h);\n````\n\n- There are different types of cameras in `three.js`:\n- [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/PerspectiveCamera)\n- [OrthographicCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/OrthographicCamera)\n- [CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/CubeCamera)\n- [StereoCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/StereoCamera)\n- [ArrayCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/ArrayCamera)\n- [Camera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/Camera)\n\nBut for now, we'll stick with the PerspectiveCamera.\n\n`PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far)`\n\n- `near`: The near clipping plane. Nothing is rendered before this distance.\n- `far`: The far clipping plane. Nothing is rendered after this distance.\n- `fov`: The field of view.\n- `aspect`: The aspect ratio.\n\n**Want to render at a different resolution?** \n\u003e Use the `setSize` method. If you wish to keep the size of your app but render\nit at a lower resolution, you can do so by calling setSize with false as\nupdateStyle (the third argument). For example, `setSize(window.innerWidth/2,\nwindow.innerHeight/2, false)` will render your app at half resolution, given\nthat your `\u003ccanvas\u003e` has 100% width and height.\n\nLet's add a cube to our scene.\n````js {linenos=false}\nconst geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);\nconst material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});\nconst cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);\nscene.add(cube);\ncamera.position.z = 5;\n````\n\n\u003e By default, when we call scene.add(), the thing we add will be added to the\ncoordinates (0,0,0). This would cause both the camera and the cube to be inside\neach other. To avoid this, we simply move the camera out a bit.\n\n**Rendering the scene**\n\n\u003e If you copied the code from above into the HTML file we created earlier, you\nwouldn't be able to see anything. This is because we're not actually rendering\nanything yet. For that, we need what's called a render or animate loop.\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Using Three.js to Add 3D Elements to your Websites](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/design/using-three-js-to-add-3d-elements-to-your-websites)","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T09:30:38.980113444Z","tags":null},"/public/typescript":{"title":"TypeScript","content":"\nSome links I'm collecting:\n- [Get Started With Typescript in 2019](https://robertcooper.me/post/get-started-with-typescript-in-2019)","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T09:30:38.980113444Z","tags":null},"/public/ubuntu-environment":{"title":"Ubuntu Environment","content":"\n- Last carried out with `Ubuntu 20.0.4`\n\n\n## General\n\n### Install `htop`\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install htop \n```\n\n### Install `git`\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install git \n```\n\n### Install build tools\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n```\n\n### Connect to your Android or Apple devices\n\n1.

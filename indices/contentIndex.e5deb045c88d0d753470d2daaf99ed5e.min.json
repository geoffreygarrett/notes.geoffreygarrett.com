{"/":{"title":"Geoffrey's Notes","content":"\n## Maps of Content üó∫Ô∏è\n\nHere are the current maps to my notes. What you see here will change overtime.\nThey won't disappear, they might just be reshuffled and organised under new maps\nthat I deem necessary to add at a later time. For example, I currently have the\nmaps of [software engineering](public/software-engineering.md) and [machine\nlearning](public/machine-learning.md) present, with some [machine learning\nalgorithms](public/dbscan.md) in [software\nengineering](public/software-engineering.md), both of which _may_ later be\nfound under **computer science**. Feel free to peruse, some notes may have\ncomments enabled if I feel that a note is well-developed enough.\n\n- [Linear Algebra MOC](public/linear-algebra.md)\n- [Estimation Theory MOC](public/estimation-theory.md)\n- [Information Theory MOC](public/information-theory.md)\n- [Software Engineering MOC](public/software-engineering.md)\n- [Machine Learning MOC](public/machine-learning.md)\n\n## Useful üõ†Ô∏è\n\nThis section is a general catch-all for anything I feel I want to keep visible\non the surface. They might help me organise my thoughts in the long-term, or\nlookup information and resources that I desire at my fingertips.\n\n- [Concept Definitions](public/concept-definitions.md)\n- [Writing Guide](https://salman.io/public/writing/)\n- [Reflection on two years of writing evergreen notes: not optimal for skill acquisition and learning](https://engineeringideas.substack.com/p/reflection-on-two-years-of-writing)\n- [All Notes](/public)\n\n## Types of Notes ‚ÑπÔ∏è\n\nAs I pursue tending to my digital garden, with new additions, or modifications\nto existing parts, you can expect me to (loosely) follow a (hopefully)\nconsistent categorisation described by the following:\n\n- üå∞ A **Seed** might just be a note, link or some thought. Perhaps a\n  placeholder for something I'd like to pursue later. These may be linked or\n  unlinked, perhaps hidden away where no one sees them.\n- üå± A **Seedling** is more established and ready to continue growing. It has \n  some weak parts, but it's getting there with time. Ideally it won't stay \n  a seedling for much longer, it just needs a bit of tending, water and sunshine.\n- üå≤ An **Evergreen** has finished growing. It could do with some pruning once\n  in a while throughout the seasons, but it's mature and isn't expected to\n  disappear in our lifetime.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-28T15:07:54.414060879Z","tags":null}}
